# dancefloor-video-trigger

Write me a Chromium extension that triggers a seperate window to open that plays a video on a loop every time music being played out of that instance of Chromium meets some requirements; the music must be at least 172 BPM, have near constant sub bass frequencies being outputted (so the video only plays if the song playing is a big dancefloor style track, it should only trigger when the main phrase of the song plays, not the intro) or has constant 4x4 bass kicks.
